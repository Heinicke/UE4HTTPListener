# Unreal Engine HTTPListener  

This project was created as a way to dynamically start and stop dedicated servers based on a request from HTTP.

## Getting Started

The code should run as is and will except requests on port 80. The code requires a few values to be passed in via headers.

### Prerequisites

You will need .net framework for this server to run. If you can run C++ applications on your computer/server
you should have no issue running this.

```
A Dedicated build of your game is required for this to work properly. The primary purpose of this project is for dedicated servers
and is not intended to support listen or peer to peer.
